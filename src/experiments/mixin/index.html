    <h1>JavaScript Mixin Experiments</h1>
    <ul id="results"></ul>
    <p>Research and experiments done while thinking about extracting the code we use in the MD2D model
      that manages getting and setting properties and managing property change listeners and events
      and am thinking of mixin patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought Angus Croll's article <a href="http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2011/05/31/a-fresh-look-at-javascript-mixins/">
      A Fresh Look at JavaScript Mixins</a> interesting. He finds it useful to think of mixins as "a process not an object".
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspired by section "4: Adding Caching" I put together this sample of patterns. The last example I created
      shows a pattern I hadn't seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
      addMixin4 adds a counter() function that creates it's own closure variable in the scope of the function in the Model object it is mixed into.
    </p>
    <p>
      The addMixin4 itself has a closure variable that is changed by ANY Model objects use of the counter() function.
